I am passionate about the intersection of Machine Learning and Data Science, and strive to create solutions that are both accessible and efficient, while utilizing robust code. I am constantly seeking opportunities to advance my knowledge and skills in these areas, as well as expanding my skill set to include programming languages such as Rust, Flutter, and Dart.
